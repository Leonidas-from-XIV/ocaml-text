* What it is ?

Encoding is a small library which deals with character encodings and
UTF-8 encoded strings manipulation.

It focus on being simple and compatible with other ocaml libraries. It
defines no new types for strings or characters, it uses only regular
strings.

* Requirement

Encoding needs only ocaml. It has been written/tested with ocaml 3.11.

* Building and installation

To build and install it just type:

  $ make all
  $ make install

This will install the "encoding" package (ocamlfind is required).

* Development

The last development version of encoding can always be found in the
darcs repository hosted at darcs.ocamlcore.org:

  $ darcs get http://darcs.ocamlcore.org/repos/encoding/encoding

local variables:
mode: outline
end:
