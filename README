* What it is ?

Encoding is a small library which deals with character encodings. It
allow you to encode/decode/recode from/to any input/output type.

Its main goal is to make the usage of character encoding in ocaml
painless.

* What it is not ?

It is not a full unicode library like camomile, it only focus on being
light, simple and generic.

* Requirement

Encoding needs only ocaml. It has been written/tested with ocaml 3.11.
If you got the development version, you also need python.

* Building and installation

To build and install it just type:

  $ make all
  $ make install

This will install the "encoding" package (ocamlfind is required).

To build examples, type:

  $ make examples

For the iconv_lwt example you need the lwt library.

* Development

The last development version of encoding can always be found in the
darcs repository hosted at darcs.ocamlcore.org:

  $ darcs get http://darcs.ocamlcore.org/repos/encoding/encoding

local variables:
mode: outline
end:
