\section{Introduction}

\oct is a library for manipulation of unicode text. It can replace the
\texttt{String} module of the standard library when you need to access
to strings as sequence of UTF-8 encoded unicode characters.

It also supports encoding (resp. decoding) of unicode text into
(resp. from) a lot of different characrter encodings.

\section{Character encoding}

\oct uses \texttt{libiconv} to transcode between variaous character
encodings. The \texttt{libiconv} itself is quite painfull to use, \oct
tries to offer a cleaner interface, which is located in the module
\texttt{Encoding}.

\subsection{Decoding}

Decoding means extracting a unicode character from a sequence of
bytes. To decode text, the first thing to do is to create a decoder;
this is done by the \texttt{Encoding.decoder} function:

\begin{verbatim}
val decoder : Encoding.t -> Encoding.decoder
\end{verbatim}

The type \texttt{Encoding.t} is the type of character encoding. It is
defined as an alias to the type string; in fact it is simply the name
of the character encoding, such as \texttt{``UTF-8''},
\texttt{``ASCII''}, ...

The decoder allow you to decode characters, by using the decode
function:

\begin{verbatim}
val decode : decoder -> string -> int -> int -> decoding_result
\end{verbatim}

It takes as arguments:
\begin{itemize}
\item a decoder, of type \texttt{Encoding.decoder}
\item a buffer $buf$, which contains encoded characters
\item an offset $ofs$ in the buffer
\item a length $len$.
\end{itemize}

\texttt{decode} will read up to $len$ bytes in the buffer, starting at
the offset $ofs$. If the bytes does not contains a valid multi-byte
sequence, it will returns \texttt{Dec\_error}. If the decoder read
$len$ bytes without reaching the end of the multi-byte sequence, it
returns \texttt{Dec\_need\_more}. If it succeed, it returns
\texttt{Dec\_ok(code\_point, num)} where \texttt{code\_point} is the
code-point that has been successfully decoded, ad \texttt{num} is the
number of bytes consumed.

\subsection{Encoding}

Encoding means transforming a unicode character into a sequence of
bytes, depending of the character encoding. Encoding characters works
almost like decoding. The first things is to create a decoder with:

\begin{verbatim}
val encoder : Encoding.t -> Encoding.encoder
\end{verbatim}

then, encoding is done by:

\begin{verbatim}
val encode : encoder -> string -> int -> int -> code_point -> encoding_result
\end{verbatim}

Arguments have the same meaning that for decoding, except that the
buffer will be written insteand of read. \texttt{encode} will write
into the buffer the multi-byte sequence correspoing to the given
code-point. On success it returns \texttt{Enc\_ok num} where
\texttt{num} is the number of bytes written. If the unicode character
cannot be represented in the given encoding, it returns
\texttt{Enc\_error}. If the buffer does not contain enough room for
the multi-byte seuqnece, it returns \texttt{Enc\_need\_more}..

\subsection{The system encoding}

The system character encoding, \texttt{Encoding.system} is determined
by environment variables. If you print non-ascii text on a terminal,
it is a good idea to encode it in the system encoding. You may also
use transliteration (see section \ref{special-encoding}) to prevent
failling when unicode character cannot be encoded in the system
encoding.

\subsection{Special encodings}
\label{special-encoding}

The \texttt{libiconv} library allow character encoding names to be
suffixed by \texttt{//IGNORE} or \texttt{//TRANSLIT}. The first one
means that character that cannot be represented in given encoding are
skipped silently. The secong means that these characters will be
approximated. Note that \texttt{//TRANSLIT} depends on the current
locale settings.

For example, consider the following program:

\begin{verbatim}
print_endline (Encoding.recode_string
                 ~src:"UTF-8"
                 ~dst:"ASCII//TRANSLIT"
                 "Mon nom est Jérémie")
\end{verbatim}

According to the current locale settings, the printing will be
different:

\begin{verbatim}
$ LANG=fr_FR.UTF-8 ./a.out
Mon nom est Jeremie
$ LANG=C ./a.out
Mon nom est J?r?mie
\end{verbatim}

The advantage of transliteration is that encoding text will never
fail, and give an acceptable result.

\section{Text manipulation}

The \texttt{Text} module of \oct is designed to handle unicode text
manipulation. By unicode text, we means sequence of unicode
characters, and not sequence of bytes. However, to stay compatible
with the rest of the ocaml world which uses only standard latin-1
strings, and to keep pattern matching over unicode text, \oct choose
to represent text as UTF-8 strings, without using an abstract
type. This is OK as long as you respect the following rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Text is immutable:} never modify in place the contents of
  a string containing text
\item \textbf{Never trust inputs:} always check for
  validity text comming from the outside world
\item \textbf{Use the right functions:} if you want to iterate over
  characters of a text, compute the number of characters contained
  in a text, ...  use \texttt{UTF-8} aware functions
\end{itemize}

The module \texttt{Text} always assumes that strings it receive
contains valid \texttt{UTF-8} encoded text. It is your job to ensure
it is the case.

\subsection{UTF-8 validation}

\emph{UTF-8 validation} consists on verifying whether a string
contains valid UTF-8 encoded text. This can be done with one of these
two functions:

\begin{verbatim}
val check : string -> string option
val validate : string -> unit
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{Text.check} receive a string, and returns \texttt{Some error}
if the given string does not contains valid UTF-8 encoded
text. Otherwise it returns \texttt{None}. \texttt{Text.validate} does
the same thing but raises an exception instead of returning an option.

For example:

\begin{verbatim}
# Text.check "Hello";;
- : string option = None
# Text.check "\xff";;
- : string option = Some "at offset 0: invalid start of UTF-8 sequence"
# Text.validate "Hello";;
- : unit = ()
# Text.validate "\xff";;
Exception:
Text.Invalid ("at offset 0: invalid start of UTF-8 sequence", "\255").
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Iteration}

Since UTF-8 encoded character use variable sequence length, iteration
over a text can not be done the same way as iteration over a byte
array. Indeed, to get the nth character of a text, you need to scan
the whole text before the character.

Instead, \oct provides an API to iterate over a text by using pointers
(of type \texttt{Text.pointer}). A pointer represent the position of a
UTF-8 encoded unicode character in a text. You can create a pointer by
using one of these three functions:

\begin{verbatim}
val pointer_l : t -> pointer
  (** Returns a pointer to the left of the given text *)

val pointer_r : t -> pointer
  (** Returns a pointer to the right of the given text *)

val pointer_at : t -> int -> pointer
  (** [pointer_at txt n] returns a pointer to the character at
      position [n] in [txt]. *)
\end{verbatim}

Once you have a pointer, you scan text to the right or left. Here is a
simple example, where we scan the given text to find a character ``.'':

\begin{verbatim}
let search txt =
  let rec loop pointer =
    match Text.next pointer with
      | None ->
          (* End of the text *)
          false
      | Some(".", pointer) ->
          true
      | Some(ch, pointer) ->
          loop pointer
  in
  loop (Text.pointer_l txt)
\end{verbatim}

Each call to \texttt{Text.next} returns either \texttt{None} if the
end of the text have been reached, or \texttt{Some(ch, pointer)} where:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{ch} is the character pointed by the pointer
\item \texttt{pointer} is a pointer to the next character or the end of text
\end{itemize}

\texttt{Text.prev} works in the same way.

Of course, using pointers is the last resort when the functions of the
module \texttt{Text} are not sufficient.

\section{Regular expressions with PCRE}

If compiled with support for PCRE, \oct define a syntax extension for
writing human readable regular expressions in ocaml sources.

\subsection{Enabling the syntax extension}

If you are using \texttt{ocamlfind}, simply adds the ``text.pcre'' to
the list of packages. For example, to compile a file ``foo.ml'' using
the syntax extension, just type:

\begin{verbatim}
$ ocamlfind ocamlc -syntax camlp4o -package text.pcre -linkpkg -o foo foo.ml
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Syntax of regular expression}

Here is the grammar of regular expressions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\emph{string literal}} matches exactly the given string
\item \textbf{\emph{\_}} (underscore) matches any character, except
  new-line in non multiline mode
\item \textbf{\emph{regexp regexp}} match the concatenation of the two
  given regular expression
\item \textbf{\emph{regexp $\mid$ regexp}} matches the first regular
  expression or the second
\item \textbf{\emph{regexp\{n\}}} matches n times the given regular
  expression
\item \textbf{\emph{regexp\{n-m\}}} matches at least $n$ times and up to
  $m$ times the given regular expression
\item \textbf{\emph{regexp\{n+\}}} matches at least $n$ times the given
  regular expression, and maybe more
\item \textbf{\emph{regexp*}} matches the given regular expression 0
  time or more. This is the same as \textbf{\emph{regexp\{0+\}}}
\item \textbf{\emph{regexp+}} matches the given regular expression 1
  time or more. This is the same as \textbf{\emph{regexp\{1+\}}}
\item \textbf{\emph{regexp?}} matches the given regular expression 0
  time or 1 time. This is the same as \textbf{\emph{regexp\{0-1\}}}
\item \textbf{\emph{[ character-set ]}} matches any character of
  \textbf{\emph{character-set}}
\item \textbf{\emph{[\^\ character-set ]}} matches any character that
  is not a member of \textbf{\emph{character-set}}
\item \textbf{\emph{( regexp )}} matches \textbf{\emph{regexp}}
\item \textbf{\emph{$<$ regexp}} does a look behing
\item \textbf{\emph{$<!$ regexp}} does a negative look behing
\item \textbf{\emph{$>$ regexp}} does a look ahead (without consuming any character)
\item \textbf{\emph{$>!$ regexp}} does a negative look ahead (without consuming any character)
\item \textbf{\emph{regexp as ident}} matches \textbf{\emph{regexp}}
  and bind the result to the variable \textbf{\emph{ident}}
\item \textbf{\emph{regexp as ident : type}} matches
  \textbf{\emph{regexp}} and bind the result to the variable
  \textbf{\emph{ident}}, mapping it with the function
  \texttt{\emph{type\_of\_string}}
\item \textbf{\emph{regexp as ident := func}} matches
  \textbf{\emph{regexp}} and bind the result to the variable
  \textbf{\emph{ident}}, mapping it with the function
  \texttt{\emph{func}} which may be any ocaml expression
\item \textbf{\emph{$\backslash$ ident}} is a backward reference to a
  previously bounded variable
\item \textbf{\emph{ident}} matches the regular expression contained
  in the variable \textbf{\emph{ident}}
\item \textbf{\emph{if ident then regexp}} matches
  \textbf{\emph{regexp}} if \textbf{\emph{ident}} as been previously
  matched.
\item \textbf{\emph{if ident then regexp else regexp}} is the same as
  the previous contruction but with an else branch.
\item \textbf{\emph{$\&+$ mode}} enable the given mode
\item \textbf{\emph{$\&-$ mode}} disable the given mode
\end{itemize}

A \emph{string literal} can be any string, with classic ocaml escape
sequence. Moreover, it also support the new escape sequence
$\backslash u\{XXXX\}$ where $XXXX$ is a unicode code-point written in
hexadecimal. For example $\backslash u\{e9\}$ correspond to the
latin-1 character ``é''.

\subsection{Quotations}

The syntax extension defines two camlp4 quotations, that might be used
in expressions or in patterns. The first one is
``\texttt{re\_text}''. It takes a regular expression as defined before
and convert it to a string, following the syntax of PCRE.

For example:

\begin{verbatim}
let re = Pcre.regexp <:re_text< "foo" _* "bar" >>
\end{verbatim}

The goal of this quotation is to make regular expression more
readable. The second quotation, ``\texttt{re}'' expands into a
compiled regular expression, of type \texttt{Pcre.regexp}, for examples:

\begin{verbatim}
let re = <:re< "foo" _* "bar" >>
let f str = Pcre.exec ~rex:<:re< "foo" _* "bar" >> str
\end{verbatim}

Note that in both case, the regular expression will be compiled only
one time. And in the second example, it will be compiled the first
time it is used (by using lazy evaluation).

But the more interesting use of this quotation is in pattern
matchings. It is possible to put a regular expression in an arbitrary
pattern, and capture variables.

Here is a simple example of what you can do:

\begin{verbatim}
let rec f = function
  | <:re< "foo" (_* as x) "bar" >> :: _ -> Some x
  | _ :: l -> f l
  | [] -> None
\end{verbatim}

If is also possible to use several regular expressions in the same
pattern:

\begin{verbatim}
  match v with
    | <:re< "foo" (_* as x) "bar" >> :: <:re< "a"* " " "b"* >> :: _ -> ...
    ...
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Variables}

Variables are identifiers, starting with a lower or upper case letter,
which are bound to a regular expression. By default \oct defines
variables for each posix characters class: \texttt{lower},
\texttt{upper}, \texttt{alpha}, \texttt{digit}, \texttt{alnum},
\texttt{punct}, \texttt{graph} \texttt{print}, \texttt{blank},
\texttt{cntrl}, \texttt{xdigit}, \texttt{space} \texttt{ascii},
\texttt{word}. Each one matches exactly one character. Note that they
match only ASCII letters.

\oct also defines variables for unicode properties. For example
\texttt{Ll}, will match all lowercase letters, including non-ASCII
ones. For a list of all unicode properties, look at the manual page
\texttt{pcresyntax(3)}.

\oct defines variables for each script, such as \texttt{Arabic} or
\texttt{Greek}.

In addition, it defines the following variables:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{hspace} matching any horizontal space character, including non-ASCII ones
\item \texttt{vspace} matching any vertical space character, including non-ASCII ones
\item \texttt{bound} matching any word boundary character, including non-ASCII ones
\item \texttt{bos} matching the beginning of a subject, whatever the current mode is
\item \texttt{eos} matching the end of a subject, whatever the current mode is
\end{itemize}

New variables can be defined by toplevel bindings. For instance:

\begin{verbatim}
let digit3 = <:re< ["0"-"9"]{3} >>
\end{verbatim}

will generate the binding for the \texttt{digit3} variable and define
the regexp variable \texttt{digit3} for the rest of the file.

If the contents of a variable matches text of length 1, it can be used
in character set. And if possible, it can be negated by prefixing it
with a ``\texttt{!}''. All predefined variables and all character set
variables can be negated.

\subsection{Modes}

Modes may be activated (resp. disabled) by using the syntax
``\texttt{$\&+$ mode}'' (resp. ``\texttt{$\&-$ mode}'') in a regular
expression. Available modes are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{i} or \emph{caseless}: performs case-insentive matching
\item \emph{m} or \emph{multiline}: pass into multiline mode;
  \texttt{\^} and \texttt{\$} will match the beginning and end of
  lines instead of beginning and end of subject
\item \emph{s}, \emph{singleline} or \emph{dotall}: the \texttt{\_}
  will match any characters, including newline ones.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Greedy vs possessive vs lazy}

The post-operators $?$, $+$, $*$, and more generally $\{...\}$ may be
suffixed with one of $?$ or $+$ to modify their behaviour. By default
regular expressions are greedy, which means that they match the
maximum possible they can. Suffixing them with $?$ will make them
lazy, which means the contrary.

For example, consider the following function:

\begin{verbatim}
let f = function
  | <:re< "a"* as x >> -> Some x
  | _ -> None
\end{verbatim}

if we apply it on $aaa$ we got:

\begin{verbatim}
$ f "aaa";;
- : Text.t option = Some "aaa"
\end{verbatim}

Now, if we make the matching $"a"*$ lazy:

\begin{verbatim}
let f = function
  | <:re< "a"*? as x >> -> Some x
  | _ -> None
\end{verbatim}

we got:

\begin{verbatim}
$ f "aaa";;
- : Text.t option = Some ""
\end{verbatim}

Possessive prevents backtracking. For example, with:

\begin{verbatim}
let f = function
  | <:re< ("a"* as x) ("a" as y) >> -> Some(x, y)
  | _ -> None
\end{verbatim}

we got:

\begin{verbatim}
$ f "aaa";;
- : Text.t option = None
\end{verbatim}

\end{document}
